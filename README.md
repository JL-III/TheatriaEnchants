# TheatriaEnchants

## Overview

"TheatriaEnchants" is a Minecraft plugin designed to introduce new, innovative enchantments, fueled by the power of unique items called Power Crystals. These enchantments offer enhanced abilities and create engaging gameplay experiences.

## Vision

The goal is to design this plugin with scalability, modularity, and maintainability at its core. The project uses the concept of "Separation of Concerns", encapsulating the enchantment behavior and tool behavior separately, promoting extensibility and ease of modifications. Furthermore, this structure supports the addition of more enchantments and tools in the future with minimal adjustments to the existing codebase.

## Features

- **Power Crystals**: These are unique items that fuel the enchantments and can be found throughout the world.
- **Titan Tools**: Special tools that can be imbued with enchantments powered by the Power Crystals.
- **Unique Enchantments**: A variety of enchantments, each with their own unique gameplay effects and mechanics.
